This makes [preev.com](http://preev.com) quickly available in your menubar.
preev is a simple bitcoin converter website that let's you calculate BTC to other currencies.

###Usage
Considering you have `electron` installed globally [Learn more](https://github.com/electron/electron#downloads):

 - Clone or download this repo to a directory of your choice
 - Navigate your Terminal to this directory with `cd path-of-your-choice`
 - `electron . &` will run this menubar item in the background. (You can close & exit your Terminal afterwards)


Since this is only hacked together in a short time. I have yet to research how to add and support a native build process.
For now you'll have to redo steps 2 and 3 after a reboot or relogin.

###Thank you's
Kudos to @electron and @maxogden for his great [menubar](https://github.com/maxogden/menubar) package - plus of course the people that built & maintain preev.com.
